OVER VIEW:

Designed and implemented an extensive network infrastructure for a college using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project involved creating a detailed 
network topology to connect various blocks and branches within the college campus, ensuring robust and reliable communication across the entire 
institution. By configuring routers, switches, and other networking devices, the network facilitated efficient data transfer and connectivity 
among different departments and facilities. The solution included IP addressing, subnetting, and routing protocols to optimize network performance
and ensure seamless integration of all campus systems.


So,you guy's can use CISCO PACKET TRACER to run this file and goo through the PROJECT.PKT file to get complete project.Just ping the IP address in the Command prompt of that pc.
